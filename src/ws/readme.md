# WebSocket Push Server
## Installation
1. Put [Workerman](https://github.com/walkor/Workerman) framework here and rename its root directory to `Workerman`
2. Rename `conf.php.example` to `conf.php`, and provide your own SSL certificate path
3. That's it. *You can also change other variables to your taste, but you'll need to change the corresponding things in the main backend and frontend code.*
